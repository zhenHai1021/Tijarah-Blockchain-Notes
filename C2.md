Scalable and Efficiency: More easily scaled to meet specific business needs. Especially growing transaction volumes throughput and faster confirmation compared to the public. It is beneficial for businesses that require rapid and enormous volume transactions.

Reduced Energy consumption and Low Cost: Use consensus mechanisms that are less energy-intensive compared to the Proof-of-Work that is often used by public Blockchain. Advantageous for the organization aiming to minimize the environmental impact. Fewer participants, transaction costs can be lower compared to public Blockchains, dealing with high volume of transactions.

Compliance with Regulations: Designed to comply with specific regulations. Sectors such as finance and healthcare, where strict adherence to rules is essential.

Customization and faster adoption: Flexible to customize according to their specific needs. More palatable (acceptable) for traditional businesses as allow to experiment with Blockchain technology without fully exposing their operations to the public, with unique requirements that may not be met by public Blockchains.
