# Blockchain Architecture
## 1. What is A Private Blockchain?

**Permission** and **restrictive** Blockchain that operates in a **closed network**. Such blockchain is often generally used within an organization where only particular members are **participants** of a Blockchain network. A private blockchain network requires an **invitation** or **set of rules** established, which must be **approved** by the network founder. This limits who is authorized to engage in the network, by condition participants must get an **invitation or authorization**. Private blockchain is suitable for **enterprises** and businesses that aim for internal uses, when a company wants to benefit from blockchain qualities without exposing its network to the public. Sector including Digital identification, supply chain, banking sector or, healthcare data cases. 

Pros </br>
**Enhanced privacy and confidentiality**: Restrict access to authorized participants, ensuring sensitive information is not visible to the public.

**Greater control**: Participants in a private sector have more control over the consensus mechanism, governance, and the overall rules of the network. This allows for faster decision making and adaption to specific business requirements.

**Scalable and Efficiency**: More easily scaled to meet specific business needs. Especially growing transaction volumes throughput and faster confirmation compared to the public. It is beneficial for businesses that require rapid and enormous volume transactions.

**Reduced Energy consumption and Low Cost**: Use consensus mechanisms that are less energy-intensive compared to the Proof-of-Work that is often used by public Blockchain. Advantageous for the organization aiming to minimize the environmental impact. Fewer participants, transaction costs can be lower compared to public Blockchains, dealing with high volume of transactions.

**Compliance with Regulations**: Designed to comply with specific regulations. Sectors such as finance and healthcare, where strict adherence to rules is essential.

**Customization and faster adoption**: Flexible to customize according to their specific needs. More palatable (acceptable) for traditional businesses as allow to experiment with Blockchain technology without fully exposing their operations to the public, with unique requirements that may not be met by public Blockchains. Seamlessly integrate with existing system and databases as well. Smoother transition for business incorporating Blockchain technology into their operations.

Cons
**Centralization Concerns**: Limited number of participants controlling the network, potentially leading to concentration of power.

**Limited Transparency**: Restrict access to certain information, reducing the transparency compared to public Blockchains, where stakeholders require visibility into all transactions and activities.

**Security Risks**: private B heavily relies on the trustworthiness of the participating entities, if a participant is compromised, it can jeopardize the overall security of the network.

**Interoperability**: May face issues in interoperability with other blockchain networks, therefore it may hinder seamless communication and data exchange between different networks.

**Dependency Single Entity**: often depend on a single organization to maintain/operate the network. May face entity single point of failure from the entire blockchain network. Thus, collusion could lead to manipulative practices or biased decision making within the network. 

**Cost and Resources**: setting up and maintaining a private Blockchain can be costful for smaller organizations

**Limited Tokenization Opportunities**: Limitations in creating and managing tokens or cryptocurrencies. Potential for developing and implementing tokenization-based applications and business models.

**Governance**: Private blockchains may be controlled by a select group, leading to potential conflicts of interest. It may hinder decision-making processes and result in suboptimal outcomes for the networks.

Private blockchain is more **centralized** due to a single authority maintaining the network. Means that private blockchain provide **greater control** and **privacy to the networkâ€™s owners** since only authorized parties can access and participate in them. These networks are **faster** than public since they do not require solving complex algorithms before adding new transactions.
