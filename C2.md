# Blockchain Architecture
## 1. What is A Private Blockchain?

**Permission** and **restrictive** Blockchain that operates in a **closed network**. Such blockchain is often generally used within an organization where only particular members are **participants** of a Blockchain network. A private blockchain network requires an **invitation** or **set of rules** established, which must be **approved** by the network founder. This limits who is authorized to engage in the network, by condition participants must get an **invitation or authorization**. Private blockchain is suitable for **enterprises** and businesses that aim for internal uses, when a company wants to benefit from blockchain qualities without exposing its network to the public. Sector including Digital identification, supply chain, banking sector or, healthcare data cases. 

Pros </br>
**Enhanced privacy and confidentiality**: Restrict access to authorized participants, ensuring sensitive information is not visible to the public.

**Greater control**: Participants in a private sector have more control over the consensus mechanism, governance, and the overall rules of the network. This allows for faster decision making and adaption to specific business requirements.

**Scalable and Efficiency**: More easily scaled to meet specific business needs. Especially growing transaction volumes throughput and faster confirmation compared to the public. It is beneficial for businesses that require rapid and enormous volume transactions.

**Reduced Energy consumption and Low Cost**: Use consensus mechanisms that are less energy-intensive compared to the Proof-of-Work that is often used by public Blockchain. Advantageous for the organization aiming to minimize the environmental impact. Fewer participants, transaction costs can be lower compared to public Blockchains, dealing with high volume of transactions.

**Compliance with Regulations**: Designed to comply with specific regulations. Sectors such as finance and healthcare, where strict adherence to rules is essential.

**Customization and faster adoption**: Flexible to customize according to their specific needs. More palatable (acceptable) for traditional businesses as allow to experiment with Blockchain technology without fully exposing their operations to the public, with unique requirements that may not be met by public Blockchains. Seamlessly integrate with existing system and databases as well. Smoother transition for business incorporating Blockchain technology into their operations.

Cons </br>
**Centralization Concerns**: Limited number of participants controlling the network, potentially leading to concentration of power.

**Limited Transparency**: Restrict access to certain information, reducing the transparency compared to public Blockchains, where stakeholders require visibility into all transactions and activities.

**Security Risks**: private B heavily relies on the trustworthiness of the participating entities, if a participant is compromised, it can jeopardize the overall security of the network.

**Interoperability**: May face issues in interoperability with other blockchain networks, therefore it may hinder seamless communication and data exchange between different networks.

**Dependency Single Entity**: often depend on a single organization to maintain/operate the network. May face entity single point of failure from the entire blockchain network. Thus, collusion could lead to manipulative practices or biased decision making within the network. 

**Cost and Resources**: setting up and maintaining a private Blockchain can be costful for smaller organizations

**Limited Tokenization Opportunities**: Limitations in creating and managing tokens or cryptocurrencies. Potential for developing and implementing tokenization-based applications and business models.

**Governance**: Private blockchains may be controlled by a select group, leading to potential conflicts of interest. It may hinder decision-making processes and result in suboptimal outcomes for the networks.

Private blockchain is more **centralized** due to a single authority maintaining the network. Means that private blockchain provide **greater control** and **privacy to the network’s owners** since only authorized parties can access and participate in them. These networks are **faster** than public since they do not require solving complex algorithms before adding new transactions.

## 2. What is A Public Blockchain?
**Permissionless, non-restrictive, distributed ledger** system, anyone who is connected to the internet can join the network. The basic use is for exchanging cryptocurrencies and mining. It also maintains trust among the whole **community** of users in the network and feels incentivized to work towards the **public network**. Eg, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

Pros </br>
**Decentralization and Transparency**: Decentralized network of nodes, resistant to censorship or control by a single entity. Ensuring a more democratic and inclusive system. All transactions on a public Blockchain are visible to anyone in the network. Foster trust among participants from verifying transactions and the overall state of the network.

**Security**: Often use consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, which is difficult for hackers to alter transactions history or compromise the security of a network.

**Immutability**: Once a block is added to the Blockchain, it is practically impossible to alter its content. This ensures the integrity of transaction history and builds trust among users.

**Interoperability and Accessible**: Can be accessed and used by anyone across different platforms and applications. Accessible to anyone with an internet connection, providing financial services and opportunities to anyone may be excluded from the financial institutions.

**Tokenization**: Allows for the representation of various assets on the Blockchain, enabling efficient and secure transfer of ownership. Token rewards to encourage participants (miners/validators) to contribute to the network’s security.

**Trustless transactions**: Trust the underlying protocol and the consensus mechanism, ensure the validity of transactions without the need for intermediaries or government control.

Cons </br>
**Scalability**: Large no. of transactions to be handled, result in slower transaction processing times and higher fees during network congestion.

**Energy Consumption and Unpredictable cost**: Proof-of-work consensus, requires significant computational power, leading to higher energy consumption, not only raises environmental concerns but also makes the operation of the network expensive. Unpredictable transaction fees. Hard to estimate cost of transaction accurately, leading to unpredictability in expenses.

**Privacy Concerns**: Public blockchain are transparent, since all the transactions are visible to anyone. Lack of privacy can be a burden for users who want to keep confidential their financial activities.

**Regulatory**: Governments and regulators may find it hard to monitor and control activities on public blockchain. This may lead to legal uncertainties, hindering broader adoption and acceptance.

**Immutability dilemma**: Once a transaction is recorded, posing challenges in correcting mistakes. 

**Lack of Governance**: Often lack formal governance structures. Therefore, decision-making process and protocol upgrades may become contentious (heated argument), potentially leading to forks and divisions in the community.

**User-friendly**: Complex for non-technical users or non-knowledge blockchain users. This limits the widespread adoption of Blockchain technology.

**Smart contract risks**: Smart contracts are not immune to bugs or vulnerabilities. Flaws in smart contracts can lead to significant financial losses. 

Anyone can join and participate in a public blockchain network. To attract more participants to join the network, the network usually has an incentive system. One of the cons, is the amount of **computational/processing power** required to keep a distributed ledger running at a wide scale. To obtain consensus, each node in a network must solve a **sophisticated**, resource-intensive cryptographic challenge known as proof-of-work (PoW) to ensure everyone is on the same page. Another problem arise, from its openness, which implies minor to zero transaction privacy and only supports a fundamental of security.

## 3. What is the difference between private vs public blockchain vs consortium?
| Aspect | Private| Public | Consortium |
|---|---|---|--|
|
Private: Access is restricted to a specific group of participants who are typically known and permissioned by a central authority. This ensures a higher level of trust among participants. The permissioned nature allows for faster transactions and lower latency.
Public: Open to anyone without permission. Participants can join the network pseudonymously, and transactions are validated by a consensus mechanism that doesn’t rely on trust among participants. This openness promotes decentralization but lead to slower transaction speeds.
Consortium: Access is limited to a predefined group of participants. While not entirely open, it is more inclusive than a private Blockchain. The consortium determines and manages permissions.
