# Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)
System ability to continue operating even if some of its nodes fail or act maliciously

## Problem with Byzantine Generals' Problem[^1]:
- Has an army surrounding a fortress, decide to attack or retreat **TOGETHER**
- Same decision = they are successful
- Each general stayed with their armies. They can communicate with one another via messengers

- If miscommunication or 'traitors' causing some generals to attack while the others retreat, then the battle is lost.
