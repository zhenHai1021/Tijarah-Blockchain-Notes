# Notary-based by CORDA
Consensus that relies on a group of trusted entities (notaries) to validate and confirm transactions or blocks. It introduces a layer of centralization through these trusted notaries to validate and confirm transactions or blocks.

## How Notary-based Work
1. A set of trusted/pre-selected entities for validating transactions.
2. Notaries are often chosen based on reputation, expertise, or trustworthiness
3. When a transaction occurs, it is submitted to the notaries for validation
4. Notaris verify the transactionâ€™s validity and reach consensus.
5. Once the consensus is achieved, the transaction is confirmed.
