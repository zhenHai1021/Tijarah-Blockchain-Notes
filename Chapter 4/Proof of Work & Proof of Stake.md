# Consensus Mechanism
## The Need for Consensus Mechanisms in Blockchain
Consensus Mechanisms is vital for blockchain. They are the protocols that ensure all nodes in a blockchain network **agree** on the **validity of transactions**, maintaining the **integrity** and **trust** of distributed ledger. Without consensus mechanisms, blockchain would lack the necessary synchronization and agreement among nodes, leading to potential conflicts and security issues.

Why are Consensus Mechanisms Necessary?
1. Decentralization: Enable network participants to agree on the current state of the ledger, eliminate the central authority
2. Security: Protect blockchain from fraudulent transactions and malicious actors. By requiring agreement from multiple nodes, consensus mechanisms make it hard for any single entity to manipulate the ledger.
3. Integrity and Trust: Ensures that once a transaction is confirmed, it can be trusted as valid. This systemâ€™s reliability among users.
