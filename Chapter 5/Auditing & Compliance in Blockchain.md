# Auditing & Compliance in Blockchain
Auditing and compliance are vital for ensuring integrity, security and legal adherence of blockchain. As blockchain grow wider across various industries, the need for robust auditing practices and compliance with regulatory standards becomes significant.

## Importance of Auditing
<ol>
  <li>
    Transparency and Immutability
    <ol>
      <li>
        All transactions are recorded permanently and can be easily audited.
      </li>
      <li>
        Auditing helps verify the integrity of the data stored on blockchain, ensuring that it has not been tampered with and providing a tamper-proof audit trail.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Security Vulnerability
    <ol>
      <li>
        Smart contracts may have vulnerabilities that may exploited by bad actors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Help identify these vulnerabilities and enable mitigation, reduce the risk and loss.
