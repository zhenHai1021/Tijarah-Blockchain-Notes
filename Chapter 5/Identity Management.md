## Application of Blockchain in Identity Management
<ol>
  <li>
    Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): create and control their own digital identities without relying on centralized authorities. Users store their identity data on the devices and share it securely. Provide proof of identity without revealing all personal details, preserving privacy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Immutable Record: Ensure that once identity data is recorded, it cannot be altered, enhancing security. Auditability: History of identity verification/transactions is permanently recorded, providing a clear audit trail.
  </li>
  <li>
    Privacy and Consent: Choose what information they share. Selective disclosure protects privacy and minimizes data exposure. User can grant, revoke, or modify consent for data use, giving them control over their personal info.
  </li>
  <li>
    Digital IDs for Financial Services: Can streamline KYC processes, allowing users to securely and efficiently prove the identity to bank or financial institutions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cross-border identity verification: facilitate reliable and quick identity verification across borders, useful for international travel, business and e-governance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Online Authentication: Enhances online security by providing robust authentication mechanisms for various services, from email to e-commerce.
  </li>
  <li>
    Healthcare: Enable secure exchange of medical data among different healthcare organization
  </li>
  <li>
    Digital Identity for Refugees and Undocumented Individuals: Solution for refugees and undocumented individuals who lack traditional identity documents. Help financial inclusion for vulnerable populations.
  </li>
</ol>

## Technical and Operational Challenges
<ol>
  <li>
    Integration with Legacy Systems: Integrating blockchain-based identity solutions with existing systems and regulatory frameworks remains a challenge.
  </li>
  <li>
    Scalability and Performance: Managing large-scale identity data on a blockchain requires solutions that can handle high transaction throughput and data storage efficiently. Sharding, side-chains, layer-2 solutions may be required.
  </li>
  <li>
    User Experience and Adoption: Widespread adoption requires users to understand and be comfortable with managing their digital identities on blockchain platforms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Key Management: Private keys are used to control and access digital identities. Robust key generation, storage, backup and recovery mechanisms are essential to prevent identity theft or loss of control over identities.
  </li>
  <li>
    Governance and Regulation: Must comply with relevant regulations, such as KYC, AML, GDPR laws. Establishing clear governance frameworks among entities.
  </li>
  <li>
    Performance and Latency: Performance limitations and latency issues, particularly in cases where real-time identity verification or data access is required. Optimizing consensus, implementing caching strategies, or exploring hybrid architectures may address performance requirements.
  </li>
