<ol>
  <li>
    Decentralization
    <ul type="a">
      <li>
        Technical: No central point of failure or control server, hence resilient to attacks
      </li>
      <li>
        Nodes: Ensure that each node follows rules, maintaining the ledgerâ€™s integrity across the network. Each of the nodes share the resources distributed.
      </li>
    </ul>
