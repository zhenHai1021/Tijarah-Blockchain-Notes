# Security & Privacy in Blockchain

## Security Aspect
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    Decentralization
    <ol>
      <li>
        Technical: No central point of failure or control server, hence resilient to attacks
      </li>
      <li>
        Nodes: Ensure that each node follows rules, maintaining the ledgerâ€™s integrity across the network. Each of the nodes share the resources distributed.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Cryptographic
    <ol>
      <li>
        Hash Function: Transactions are cryptographically secured and linked, making it extremely difficult to tamper with recorded data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): Private and public key pairs are implemented for transaction authentication. Ensure integrity and authenticity.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Consensus Mechanism
    <ol>
      <li>
        Example: Protocols include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and more validate transactions and blocks. They ensure that only legitimate transactions are chained to the blockchain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Trade off: Each of the consensus may be advantageous in efficiency, security with some trade-offs scalability and interoperability.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Immutability
    <ol>
      <li>
        Distributed ledger: Cryptographic linking of blocks, where each block contains the hash of the previous block.
      </li>
      <li>
        Modification: Once data is added to the blockchain, nearly impossible to alter. Merkle tree merge each of two nodes to one lastMerkle Root.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## Privacy Aspect
<ol>
  <li>
    Pseudonymity
    <ol>
      <li>
        Anonymity: Users are identified by pseudonymous addresses, providing a degree of privacy and anonymity.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Enhance Privacy Protocols
    <ol>
      <li>
        Zero Knowledge Proofs: Allow translation validation without revealing detailed information, extra layer of privacy 
      </li>
      <li>
        Ring signature: In some cryptocurrencies, ring signatures provide anonymity to the sender by masking their identity within a group of users
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Selective Disclosure
    <ol>
      <li>
        Disclosure:  Users can choose which information to share, enhancing control over personal data.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## Security Challenge
<ol>
  <li>
    Scalability
    <ol>
      <li>
        As the blockchain network grows, scalability may be issued, potentially affecting security and performance.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Quantum Computing
    <ol>
      <li>
        Quantum computing could potentially finish some cryptographic nearly impossible practices, just matter of time and technology
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
   <li>
    Vulnerability
    <ol>
      <li>
        Smart contracts may contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
      </li>
      <li>
        51% attack, if a single entity controls the majority of the network computing power, would potentially monopoly or manipulate the blockchain.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Key Management
    <ol>
      <li>
        Proper network configuration and management help safeguard against private keys or any authentication being compromised.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## Privacy Challenge
<ol>
  <li>
    Transaction Traceability
    <ol>
      <li>
        While address are pseudonymous, transaction on public blockchains are transparent and potentially can be traced back to one.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Privacy Leaks
    <ol>
      <li>
        Metadata and usage patterns could potentially reveal sensitive information about users.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Regular and Compliance
    <ol>
      <li>
        Balancing privacy with regulatory requirements for anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) can be challenging.
      </li>
      <li>
        Especially finance, comply with various regulations from different regions, including data protection, violation and privacy laws.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
